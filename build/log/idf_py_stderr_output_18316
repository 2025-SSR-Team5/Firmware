CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory D:/Firmware/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/issaimaru/esp/2025-SSR-Team5/Firmware/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "D:/Firmware/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/issaimaru/esp/2025-SSR-Team5/Firmware/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
